To get your bot up and running, just add a `configuration.json` file in the main directory.
The file should be orientated at the following format:

    {
    "applications": [
        {
            "applicationId": "your-application-id",
            "publicKey": "your-public-key",
            "token": "your-token"
        }
    ],
    "consoleSpace": 18,
    "database": {}

}

Feel free to make changes whereever you want and modify this template to make it fit your bot application. If you want to publish an aplication based on this template, make sure to read the license. Please do not hesitate using this template nevertheless, that is what it is for. The license just makes sure that commercial applications based on this template cannot claim these scripts as theirs.
If there are any errors while executing the scripts, please contact me or create an issue and i will try to fix it. I always want this template to work best since i also have some bots based on it.

To control the database and the application commands manually you can use the scripts in the directory `management`. The script `resetCommands.js` will unregister all application commands to then register them again. Normally you do not need this script, while starting the bot checks all it's registered application commands and compares them to the the locally saved ones. If there are any changes made on any of the application commands the bot should be able to find them and update the registered application commnad. In case it does not work properly, you then can use this script. The script `resetDatabase.js` will delete all data in the database and will just reload the data saved in the `.json` files in the directory `database/constantData`. This script has not to be used either. For deleting the database while starting your application you can simply provide the argument `-resetDatabase` or use the predefined script `test`. This might be useful while testing your application.

There are four predefined scripts you can use to control your application:

-   `resetCommands`: This executes the file `resetCommands.js`.
-   `resetDatabase`: This executes the file `resetDatabase.js`.
-   `start`: This executes the main file of the application, `application.js`.
-   `test`: This also executes the main file `application.js`, but with the argument `-reset_database` to make testing and debugging easier.

All four scripts can be executed in the console by entering `npm run <script>`.

You can provide multiple applications. To specify the application you want to start, simply provide the index of the application as an argument to start the process with `-application <applicationIndex>`. If none is provided, the application at index 0 will be chosen automatically. If the chosen token is invalid, the application will iterate over all application till the first valid token is found.

For further information about initializing a database visit [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/api/v6/class/src/sequelize.js~sequelize#instance-constructor-constructor). All listed options at this webpage can be used in the `configuration.json` file aswell. If you do not want to use a database at all, just set the value of database to `false` (or anything other falsy like `null`).
